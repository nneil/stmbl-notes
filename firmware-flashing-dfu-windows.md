# STMBL firmware flashing under Windows via USB DFU using ST DfuSe
INCOMPLETE DO NOT USE - DRAFT - MAY BE INCORRECT
This documents the initial flashing of an "empty" board.
## Download
- Download `f4.bin` (for the LV board) and `f3.bin` (for the HV board) from https://github.com/rene-dev/stmbl/releases
- Download `DfuSe Utility` from http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html 
Note that ST refer to the utility by several different names, and that the use of English in the package is not perfect. This package contains:
  - GUI utility flashing (`DfuSeDemo`)
  - Utility to create DFU files (`Dfu file manager`)
  - STM32 DFU device driver.
## Create DFU File from BIN file
The downloaded file needs to be converted from BIN to DFU. For each BIN file you must:

- Run `Dfu file manager` from the Windows Start Menu

- Click `OK` to choose `GENERATE`

- Choose `Multi Bin...`

- Click `...` to open the file

- Select the BIN file

- Enter the correct address `0x08000000`

- Click `Add to list`
- Click `OK`

- Enter the version of the firmware as a 4 digit hex number
- Click `Generate...`

- Type the name of the DFU file to be created (you can optionally add the version number as part of the name)

- Click `Save`

## Put the Board into DFU Mode
- Short the programming jumper on the board you wish to program (as pictured below)
- Apply power to that board.
- Once powered up the jumper can be removed. Windows Device Manager should show `STM Device in DFU Mode` (0483:DF11)

- Servoterm

In servoterm the command to put the boards in to  bootloader mode are 

"bootloader" for the f4 (LV Board)  
"hv bootloader" for the f3 (HV Board) 


# Flashing

- Start `DfuSeDemo`
- Under `Upgrade or Verify Action` click `Choose..`

Select `f4.dfu` for the LV board or `f3.dfu` for the HV board

- Note the version displayed is what was entered earlier in `Dfu file manager`
- Note `File correctly loaded.` message
- Tick `Verify after download`
- Click `Upgrade` to flash the firmware to the board

- Accept the warning

- Observe the `Erase Phase`, followed by the `Download Phase`

- Observe successful completion

## Servoterm
Servoterm is a specialised terminal emulator that can be used to control the STMBL. It's a Chrome Extension.
The board must be in serial mode, the power must be cycled if it was previously in DFU mode for flashing.

**Connect using a USB cable, not a "Smart Serial" cable.**

The STM32 DfuSe USB device driver must be loaded http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html

Start servoterm from the Chrome Apps menu, found on the bookmarks bar of a new tab, the URL is chrome://apps/
The command to check the firmware version is `about`
